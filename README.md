- 👋 Hi, I’m @MuhammetBozkurt0
- 👀 I started learning software in order not to fall behind in the world where technology is rapidly developing.
- 🌱 I'm learning React frontend and react native. I chose this field because I think I have an aesthetic eye. I am new in this field, but I try and I am determined.
- 💞️Since I played sports during my school years, I know team spirit and its requirements. I can act according to team needs, not individual needs.
- 📫 I have always enjoyed multicultural work environments.
- 😄 I'm looking forward to the day when I can write about my good experiences here.
